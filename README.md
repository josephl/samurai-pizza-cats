# Samurai Pizza Cats

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, I accumulated many photos of few subjects:
* Samurai - me, with feudal-era approved hair/facial har
* Pizza - homemade neapolitan-style pies became an obsession, thanks to homemade sourdough starter and Ken Forkish's excellent book [The Elements of Pizza](https://kensartisan.com/elements-of-pizza)
* Cats - Boyd & Gabby

A simple image classifier to help organize albums would be nice.

This project has no affiliation to the television program [Samurai Pizza Cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Pizza_Cats).
